## Projects

These are my projects, for your viewing pleasure.  
Whereever possible there will be either a self contained runnable artifact (an exe or a jar file), or a link to a live demo.

### Console projects

These projects employ nested while loops to present the user with menus. 


#### DbAdmin ~ spring of 2023
Console driven application to simulate the management of employees, departements and projects in a fictional company.  
The menues and their configuration is handled by a large 'god class' *Tekstgrensesnitt* with a sidekick *Statics* class to take textual user input.
It connects to an external PostgreSQL database using JPA + DAO.

### Other projects
#### TeamUp

Teamup is an unofficial extension for [Canvas LMS](https://sikt-no.translate.goog/tjenester/lms?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=no&_x_tr_pto=wapp&_x_tr_hist=true), written 
for a course about innovation.
It injects a little webapp into the existing Canvas LMS webapp, with the goal of providing enhanced functionality relating to the forming of student groups for obligatory assignments.
