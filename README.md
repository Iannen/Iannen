Hello, I'm me!

## Projects

These are my projects, for your viewing pleasure.  
Whereever possible there will be either a self contained runnable artifact (an exe or a jar file), or a link to a live demo.

### Console projects

These projects employ nested while loops to present the user with menus. 


#### DbAdmin ~ spring of 2023
Console driven application to simulate the management of employees, departements and projects in a fictional company.  
The menues and their configuration is handled by a large 'god class' *Tekstgrensesnitt* with a sidekick *Statics* class to take textual user input.
It connects to an external PostgreSQL database using JPA + DAO.
